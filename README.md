Fyyur
-----

## Introduction

Fyyur is a musical venue and artist booking site that facilitates the discovery and bookings of shows between local performing artists and venues. This site lets you list new artists and venues, discover them, and list shows with artists as a venue owner.

My job is to build out the data models to power the API endpoints for the Fyyur site by connecting to a PostgreSQL database for storing, querying, and creating information about artists and venues on Fyyur.


The goal is to make Fyyur to be the next new platform that artists and musical venues can use to find each other, and discover new music shows.

## Tech Stack (Dependencies)

### 1. Backend Dependencies
 * **SQLAlchemy ORM** is the ORM library of choice
 * **PostgreSQL** is the database of choice
 * **Python3** and **Flask** are the server language and server framework
 * **Flask-Migrate** for creating and running schema migrations


### 2. Frontend Dependencies
We have **HTML**, **CSS**, and **Javascript** with [Bootstrap 3](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.4/customize/) for our website's frontend. 


Overall:
* Models are located in the `MODELS` section of `app.py`.
* Controllers are also located in `app.py`.
* The web frontend is located in `templates/`, which builds static assets deployed to the web server at `static/`.
* Web forms for creating data are located in `form.py`



Instructions for project
-----

1. I had to understand the Project Structure and where important files are located.
2. I had to build and run local development following the Development Setup steps below.
3. I filled in the missing functionality in this application: this application currently pulls in fake data, and needs to now connect to a real database and talk to a real backend.
4. I filled out every `TODO` section throughout the codebase. We suggest going in order of the following:
    * Connect to a database in `config.py`. A project submission that uses a local database connection is fine.
    * Using SQLAlchemy, set up normalized models for the objects we support in our web app in the Models section of `app.py`. Check out the sample pages provided at /artists/1, /venues/1, and /shows for examples of the data we want to model, using all of the learned best practices in database schema design. Implement missing model properties and relationships using database migrations via Flask-Migrate.
    * Implement form submissions for creating new Venues, Artists, and Shows. There should be proper constraints, powering the `/create` endpoints that serve the create form templates, to avoid duplicate or nonsensical form submissions. Submitting a form should create proper new records in the database.
    * Implement the controllers for listing venues, artists, and shows. Note the structure of the mock data used. We want to keep the structure of the mock data.
    * Implement search, powering the `/search` endpoints that serve the application's search functionalities.
    * Serve venue and artist detail pages, powering the `<venue|artist>/<id>` endpoints that power the detail pages.

#### Data Handling with `Flask-WTF` Forms
The starter codes use an interactive form builder library called [Flask-WTF](https://flask-wtf.readthedocs.io/). This library provides useful functionality, such as form validation and error handling. You can peruse the Show, Venue, and Artist form builders in `forms.py` file. The WTForms are instantiated in the `app.py` file. For example, in the `create_shows()` function, the Show form is instantiated from the command: `form = ShowForm()`. To manage the request from Flask-WTF form, each field from the form has a `data` attribute containing the value from user input. For example, to handle the `venue_id` data from the Venue form, you can use: `show = Show(venue_id=form.venue_id.data)`, instead of using `request.form['venue_id']`.

Project Acceptance Criteria
-----

1. The web app should be successfully connected to a PostgreSQL database. A local connection to a database on your local computer is fine.
2. There should be no use of mock data throughout the app. The data structure of the mock data per controller should be kept unmodified when satisfied by real data.
3. The application should behave just as before with mock data, but now uses real data from a real backend server, with real search functionality. For example:
  * when a user submits a new artist record, the user should be able to see it populate in /artists, as well as search for the artist by name and have the search return results.
  * I should be able to go to the URL `/artist/<artist-id>` to visit a particular artistâ€™s page using a unique ID per artist, and see real data about that particular artist.
  * Venues should continue to be displayed in groups by city and state.
  * Search should be allowed to be partial string matching and case-insensitive.
  * Past shows versus Upcoming shows should be distinguished in Venue and Artist pages.
  * A user should be able to click on the venue for an upcoming show in the Artist's page, and on that Venue's page, see the same show in the Venue Page's upcoming shows section.
4. As a fellow developer on this application, I should be able to run `flask db migrate`, and have my local database (once set up and created) be populated with the right tables to run this application and have it interact with my local postgres server, serving the application's needs completely with real data I can seed my local database with.
  * The models should be completed (see TODOs in the `Models` section of `app.py`) and model the objects used throughout Fyyur.
  * Define the models in a different file to follow [Separation of Concerns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns) design principles. You can refactor the models to a new file, such as `models.py`.
  * The right _type_ of relationship and parent-child dynamics between models should be accurately identified and fit the needs of this particular application.
  * The relationship between the models should be accurately configured, and referential integrity amongst the models should be preserved.
  * `flask db migrate` should work, and populate my local postgres database with properly configured tables for this application's objects, including proper columns, column data types, constraints, defaults, and relationships that completely satisfy the needs of this application. The proper type of relationship between venues, artists, and shows should be configured.
